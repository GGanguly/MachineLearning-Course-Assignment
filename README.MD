## JHU Data Science Specialization - Machine Learning Course- Project Assignment
This repo holds the final report of the Peer Assessment project from Coursera’s course Practical Machine Learning in HTML format. It was built using RStudio, using knitr functions. The source Rmd code used for generating the report is also made available.

##Overview
This analysis meant to be the basis for the course quiz and a prediction assignment writeup. The main goal of the project is to predict the manner in which 6 participants performed some exercise as described below. This is the “classe” variable in the training set. The machine learning algorithm with the best accuracy rate was applied to the 20 test cases available in the test data and the predictions submitted in appropriate format to the Course Project Prediction Quiz for automated grading.
